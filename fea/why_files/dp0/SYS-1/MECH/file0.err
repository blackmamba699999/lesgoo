 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.141   TIME= 12:54:55
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.297   TIME= 12:54:57
 The first term of constraint equation number 4 refers to degree of      
 freedom ROTX at node 1.  This degree of freedom is not active, so       
 therefore, this constraint equation is ignored.                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.297   TIME= 12:54:57
 The first term of constraint equation number 5 refers to degree of      
 freedom ROTY at node 1.  This degree of freedom is not active, so       
 therefore, this constraint equation is ignored.                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.297   TIME= 12:54:57
 The first term of constraint equation number 6 refers to degree of      
 freedom ROTZ at node 1.  This degree of freedom is not active, so       
 therefore, this constraint equation is ignored.                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      32.156   TIME= 12:55:21
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     117.172   TIME= 12:56:46
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 2.530468207E-05 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
